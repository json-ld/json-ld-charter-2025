        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a widely used method of encoding Linked Data using JSON.
          Use of JSON-LD has grown and expanded over the last decade (since it's first publication as a
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api1/">W3C Recommendation in 2014</a>).
          JSON-LD remains a popular choice for ecoding <abbr title="Seach Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>-focused
          structured data in Web pages. JSON-LD has also become a foundational format for social media (ActivityStreams),
          Internet of Things data (Web of Things Description), Verifiable Credentials, and Software Bill of Materials (SPDX).
        </p>
        <p>This growth in the applied use of JSON-LD has resulted in community interest in additional expressions of
          JSON-LD's underlying Linked Data structure into other formats. YAML-LD has been created by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a> for easing human
          authoring and providing a clearer path for using Linked Data applied to popular YAML-based documents such as
          infrastructure as code, static site front matter, and API documentation formats. Additionally, a need has
          arised in the Verifiable Credentials space for providing a more compressed expression of JSON-LD, and work on
          CBOR-LD was begun in the JSON-LD CG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hope of this new more inclusively focused JSON-LD WG is to meet the demand of the broader
          JSON-LD community by strengthening the foundational JSON-LD specifications and aligning it with the latest
          RDF 1.2 specifications, growing the family of JSON-LD related formats which orbit around the JSON-LD
          processing model, and specifing improved context retrieval methods for greater clarity and stability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>
					The Working Group will extend the recommendations defining the JSON-LD specifications (i.e., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON-LD 1.1</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/">JSON-LD 1.1 API</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-framing/">JSON-LD 1.1 Framing</a>)
          with the features introduced by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts">RDF 1.2</a>
          in addition to open Errata and requested features
          as noted on the groups <a href="https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/84">Project Management Page</a>.
          These specifications together provide a JSON format for Linked Data to interoperate in a method which is familiar to and usable by software engineers.
					<!-- Note that the JSON-LD APIs are not browser specific; while appropriate for use within browsers, they are not limited to such use, and there is no requirement for browsers to implement them natively. -->
				</p>
        <p>
          The Working Group will also develop new Recommendation Track deliverables, based on work incubated by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a>,
          specifying the use of JSON-LD algorithms with similar formats (YAML, CBOR, and more).
        </p>
        <p>The Working Group is expected to coordinate with the <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/'>JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a> on consensus-based proposals related to content changes for the JSON-LD Working Group Deliverables. The Chairs of this group may choose to reject proposals that are incompatible with this Charter.</p>

	  <p>In order to advance beyond
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">Candidate Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites. In order to advance beyond Candidate Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>

	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
      in Candidate Recommendation
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

    <!-- W3C Statements and Web Platform Design Principles -->
    <p>This group is expected to be guided by the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web Principles</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">Privacy Principles</a>,</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.</li>
    </ul>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chairs should periodically look through the non-Members who have contributed to the Working Group or the JSON for Linking Data Community Group and consider whether each one should be invited to participate as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/">Invited Expert</a>. If a non-Member contributor would like to participate in meetings, they are encouraged to <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/json-ld/instructions/">apply to be an Invited Expert</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/json-ld">JSON-LD Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most JSON-LD Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  on <a id="public-github" href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/json-ld/tools">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of <span id='cfc'>10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
